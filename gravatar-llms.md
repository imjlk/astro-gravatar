1. Introduction
Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) is a service that allows users to create profiles linked to their email addresses. These profiles are used across millions of sites, providing consistent avatars and user identity for more than 70 million users worldwide. The Gravatar API is completely open and free to use, making it accessible for developers and organizations of all sizes.

2. Key Benefits
Consistent Identity: Users maintain uniform identity across all Gravatar-enabled platforms, with profile changes automatically staying in sync everywhere
Simplified User Onboarding: Users don’t need to repeatedly fill out profile forms across different services
Solves Cold Start Problem: Instantly access rich user profiles even for new users of your service, with higher profile completion rates by leveraging existing data rather than requiring users to create new profiles
Minimal Development Effort: Implement avatars and profiles with simple integration that eliminates the need to build and maintain your own user avatar/profile management systems, reducing development overhead significantly
Enhanced User Experience: Personalize user interactions based on profile data, especially during the critical onboarding process. Use Gravatar’s interest data to power recommendation engines and content personalization from day one.
All of these benefits are achieved simply by users sharing their email address – no additional registration process required!

3. API Capabilities
The Gravatar API allows you to:

Retrieve user profile data and avatars based on email addresses
Access rich profile data including display names, locations, biographies, job titles, verified social media accounts, and more
Display consistent user avatars and user profile data across multiple platforms and services
Upload, edit and manage avatar images (with authentication)
Generate QR codes for profiles
Update profile information directly inside your application or site (with authentication)
Implement a unified user identity system without managing profile infrastructure
4. Quick Start
4.1 Email Hash – The Universal Identifier
The email hash is the foundation of all Gravatar functionality. It serves as the universal identifier for accessing both avatars and profile data.

// CRITICAL: Generate the SHA256 hash correctly for all Gravatar operations
 
function getGravatarHash(email) {
 
  // Trim and lowercase the email - BOTH steps are required
 
  email = email.trim().toLowerCase();
 
  // Create SHA256 hash (using a crypto library)
 
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(email).digest('hex');
 
  return hash;
 
}
 
// This single hash is used for BOTH avatars AND profile data
 
const hash = getGravatarHash('user@example.com');
4.2 Avatar Integration
Use the email hash to construct avatar URLs:

// Avatar URL using the same email hash
 
const avatarUrl = `https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/${hash}`;
 
// Usage in HTML
 
// <img src="https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/27205e5c51cb03f862138b22bcb5dc20f94a342e744ff6df1b8dc8af3c865109" alt="User avatar" />
4.3 Profile Data
To fetch a user’s profile data:

const hash = getGravatarHash('user@example.com');
 
const profileUrl = `https://api.gravatar.com/v3/profiles/${hash}`;
 
// With authentication (recommended)
 
fetch(profileUrl, {
 
  headers: {
 
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
 
  }
 
})
 
.then(response => response.json())
 
.then(profile => console.log(profile));
5. Authentication
Gravatar provides API Key Authentication (Bearer Token) as the recommended method for accessing the full API capabilities.

5.1 Creating an API Key
Log in to your Gravatar account
Navigate to the Developer Dashboard
Click “Create New Application”
Fill in the required information
Save your API key securely
5.2 Using Bearer Tokens
Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

fetch('https://api.gravatar.com/v3/profiles/example', {
 
  method: 'GET',
 
  headers: {
 
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
 
  }
 
})
 
.then(response => response.json())
 
.then(data => console.log(data));
5.3 Security Best Practices
Never expose your API key in client-side code
Store your API key in environment variables
Always use HTTPS for API requests
Implement key rotation for production applications
IMPORTANT NOTE
While it’s technically possible to access limited API functionality without authentication via our legacy API, this approach is strongly discouraged as it provides access to only basic endpoints with restricted rate limits. All production implementations should use authenticated requests.

6. Core Concepts
6.1 Email Hashing
All Gravatar requests require a proper email hash. Don’t use MD5! Follow these steps precisely:

Trim leading and trailing whitespace
Convert the entire email to lowercase
Create a SHA256 hash of the processed email

// Correct email hashing for Gravatar
  
function createGravatarHash(email) {
  
  // Process the email properly
  
  const processedEmail = email.trim().toLowerCase();
  
  // Create SHA256 hash
  
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(processedEmail).digest('hex');
  
}
6.2 Rate Limiting
The Gravatar API is free to use, and its rate limits are customizable based on your needs. While default limits are set to prevent misuse, you can apply for much higher limits to accommodate specific usage requirements at no additional cost. Simply reach out to the Gravatar team and describe your use case and needs.

Default rate limits:

Authentication	Requests per Hour
API Key	1000
Rate limit information is included in response headers:

X-RateLimit-Limit: Total requests allowed in current period
X-RateLimit-Remaining: Remaining requests in current period
X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the limit resets
6.3. API Versioning
The current API version is 3.0.0 (semantic versioning).

12. Error Handling & Troubleshooting
12.1 Error Response Format
All API errors follow a consistent format:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
{
 
  "error": "Error message description",
 
  "code": "error_code"
 
}
12.2 Common Error Codes
HTTP Status	Error Code	Description	Solution
400	uncropped_image	Image is not square	Crop image to 1:1 ratio before uploading
400	unsupported_image	File format not supported	Use JPG, PNG, or GIF formats
400	INVALID_EMAIL	Invalid email format	Verify email format before request
401	N/A	Authentication failed	Check API key or OAuth token
403	insufficient_scope	Token lacks permissions	Request proper scopes during OAuth
404	disabled	Profile is disabled	No solution – user has disabled profile
429	rate_limit_exceeded	Too many requests	Implement rate limiting, use exponential backoff
500	N/A	Server error	Retry with exponential backoff
502	INVALID_RESPONSE	Invalid API response	Retry request or check API status
12.3 Troubleshooting Guide
12.3.1 Avatar Not Loading
Verify the email hash is correct (trim whitespace, lowercase)
Check if the user has set an avatar for this email
Add a default parameter to display a fallback: ?d=mp
12.3.2 Profile Not Found
Confirm you’re using the hash of the primary email on the account
Many users have multiple addresses on a single account
Avatar requests may succeed while profile requests fail for secondary emails
12.3.3 Rate Limiting Issues
Implement proper caching to reduce API calls
Add exponential backoff for retries
Apply for increased rate limits through Developer Dashboard
